# How to contribute

I really want this to be a community project so if anything isn't clear or you've not done this before please get in touch and I'll help you get started

# What should I do

Have a look at [enhancement issues](https://github.com/ChesterDevs/chester-devs-website/labels/enhancement) for a list of ideas on what would be nice to have. Alternatively, if you see a mistake or have your own idea run with it.  If it's a large piece of work it might be worth getting in touch before you get too far through.

Most issues can be broken down into Frontend development (Html, CSS, JS) and Backend development (C#). If you are more comfortable with one and not the other, mention that in the issue and we can create a project for this to allow more than one person to contribute.

# How

1. Fork the repository to create a copy of the repository in your own account
2. Clone it to your computer, create a branch and do your work
3. Consider squashing your commits to avoid lots of low value commit messages
3. Rebase your repository and branch to ensure you are upto date with master in the core repository
4. Submit a Pull Request

# Build and Deploy

This is done automatically from the master branch - [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/chester-devs)

# Website re-writes

I would love there to be multiple versions of this website. There can only be one actually used, but it would be fasciating to see how it can be done in other languages/frameworks.

If you want to have a go, create a new folder in the root of the repository named as the technology/language/framework.
