# Chester Devs Website 

This repository is the source to the [Chester Devs website](https://chester.dev/)

# Current status

This is the very start of this project to get a basic website for Chester Devs. The main driver for this is to have more control over the content we display than we currently get from Meetup

# Plans

The initial build is complete, so now it's time for you to "have at it". 

The initial build is using the following, but only because that's what I'm most familiar with and so the fastest way to get the ball rolling.

- Asp.Net Core
- Bootstrap with a theme

Please fork this repo, add features, add copies of the site in some other framework, tweak and improve where you see fit and submit a pull request.

## Hopes and dreams

- Contributor list (automatically taken from GitHub if possible)
- Pull in event listing from Meetup (subject to being able to use the api)
- Member blog posts
- Event YouTube Videos
- Separate mail list to Meetup (Mailchimp or similar)
