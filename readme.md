# Chester Devs Website 

This repository is the source to the [Chester Devs website](https://www.chesterdevs.co.uk/)

# Current status

This is the very start of this project to get a basic website for Chester Devs. The main driver for this is to have more control over the content we display than we currently get from Meetup

# Plans

Once the initial build is complete, help from members will be possible ... and encouraged

The initial build will contain the following:

- Basic who we are and when/where we meet
- Link to Meetup
- Sponsor listing
- Recruiter rules
- Nice photos of Chester

## Hopes and dreams

- Pull in event listing from Meetup (subject to being able to use the api)
- Member blog posts
- Separate mail list to Meetup (Mailchimp or similar)
